      "summary": "Click here for more articles by Kormedi.com. Tteokguk, or rice cake soup, is a Lunar New Year staple often seen as a light meal but its calories are surprisingly high. Model Han Hye-jin, known for maintaining a top physique in her 40s, has long said on TV and her personal channels, “When I eat soup-based foods, I focus on the solids and leave most of the broth.” Han has explained that she consciously reduces sodium intake, especially before shoots or photo sessions. Even when she eats soups or stews, she minimizes the broth. The reason, she said, is that salty foods can lead to facial puffiness and weight fluctuations the next day. During holidays, when oily and strongly seasoned dishes such as pan-fried foods, meat and noodles are already abundant, finishing the soup broth can sharply raise total calorie and sodium intake. Many people report noticeable weight gain after the holiday period. Why tteokguk is likened to ‘two bowls of rice’ A typical bowl of tteokguk (about 150 to 200 grams of rice cakes with beef garnish) is estimated at roughly 600 to 700 calories. Rice cakes are re"

      "summary": "A court is scheduled to deliver its verdict at 3 p.m. Thursday in former President Yoon Suk Yeol’s insurrection trial stemming from his declaration of martial law, a case in which prosecutors have sought the death penalty. The ruling comes 443 days after Yoon abruptly declared emergency martial law on Dec. 3, 2024, a move that lasted about six hours before the National Assembly voted to overturn it. Yoon was indicted in January 2025 on charges of leading an insurrection and was removed from office in April that year. The ousted president faces four separate criminal trials related to the martial law fiasco, but this case — centered on the insurrection charge — is widely seen as the one most directly linked to the declaration itself. At the final hearing on Jan. 13, the special counsel urged the court to impose the harshest sentence available — death. Prosecutors argued that the martial law imposition was a long-planned attempt to dismantle the constitutional order through the mobilization of military and police forces. Armed troops were deployed to the Assembly in an attempt to d"

In 2023, Russia recorded 5,750 applicants — a fivefold increase from a year earlier — in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. A ministry official said the conflict is believed to have had an influence on the number of Russian applications, noting the country's conscription efforts due to the war. But no Russians were granted refugee status last year, the official said. South Korea granted the status to 135 people, including 75 Burmese in 2025 alone. South Korea signed the U.N.

The event was held within the framework of Saudi Arabia’s leading role as co-chair of Track Three of the Global Initiative to Galvanize Political Commitment to International Humanitarian Law (IHL), focusing on \"reducing suffering and promoting peace: a humanitarian perspective on disarmament.” The event reflects Saudi Arabia’s commitment to supporting international efforts to enhance respect for IHL, integrate the humanitarian dimension into disarmament discussions, and promote international peace and security.Addressing the session, Prince Turki reviewed the growing challenges facing the international system amid declining respect for international law, including IHL, and the resulting escalation of conflicts and suffering among civilians. He emphasized the importance of upholding the rule of international law as a fundamental pillar for achieving peace and stability, warning that replacing the force of law with the force of power undermines international stability and fuels impunity. He also highlighted Saudi Arabia’s firm commitment to IHL, rooted in the values of Islamic Shariah, which call for mercy, justice, and the preservation of human dignity even during armed conflicts. He pointed to the Kingdom’s active role in supporting and strengthening the IHL framework through its early accession to the Geneva conventions, participation in the Global Initiative to Galvanize Political Commitment to IHL, and co-chairing Track Three, which connects IHL to peacebuilding efforts. Organizing this high-level event builds on the mission’s efforts to reinforce the Kingdom’s active presence and engagement with international organizations in Geneva, advance international discussions on IHL, and translate the Kingdom’s humanitarian orientation into practical initiatives in the multilateral arena, reflecting its steadfast commitment to supporting international peace and stability."
