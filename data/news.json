Lee issued the directive a day after a special counsel referred a case involving alleged ties between the Unification Church and lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) to police, following criticism that its probe had previously targeted only People Power Party (PPP) lawmakers. \"President Lee instructed (authorities) to conduct a thorough investigation into allegations of illegal involvement between a specific religious group and political figures, regardless of party affiliation or position,\" the office said in a press notice. Later in the day, a former Unification Church official embroiled in a corruption case linked to the administration of former President Yoon Suk Yeol was expected to name the DPK lawmakers he claims took money from the church during a final trial hearing.

Ihn, who had been closely aligned with Yoon, said Korea must work to overcome the \"unfortunate events\" that have unfolded since Yoon's failed martial law bid. With Ihn's departure, Rep.
