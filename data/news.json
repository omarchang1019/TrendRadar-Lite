Jang Dong-hyeok, chairman of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP), issued a formal apology Wednesday for the 2024 martial law fiasco, a move widely seen as an effort to distance the party from former President Yoon Suk Yeol. The apology came more than a year after Yoon, who entered office as the party's candidate, abruptly imposed martial law — a decision that led to his impeachment and criminal prosecution. \"The emergency martial law declared on Dec. 3, 2024, was an inappropriate and misguided measure that did not fit the situation. It led to significant confusion and inconvenience to the public, and inflicted deep wounds on our party members who have upheld the constitutional order of liberal democracy,\" Jang said at a press conference at the party's headquarters. \"As the ruling party at the time and a key pillar of state governance, we failed to fulfill our responsibilities,\" he added. \"We take that responsibility very seriously.

The conflict comes as Korea grapples with the highest elderly poverty rate in the developed world, with nearly 40 percent of those over 65 living in relative poverty. Against a backdrop of low public social spending, Babfor — Korean for \"sharing rice\" — remains a critical stopgap, feeding up to 1,000 people daily.
