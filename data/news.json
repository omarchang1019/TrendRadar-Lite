A 1.5 million won ($1,050) fine. The Daegu District Court cited the defendant's confession, lack of a criminal record, and past volunteer work at a dog shelter as reasons for leniency. This ruling is not an outlier. Despite public outrage, Korea’s judicial system continues to hand down light sentences for animal cruelty, according to legal experts and data analysis. A recent case in Gongju, South Chungcheong Province, shows how far court rulings fall short of justice. A farm owner was sentenced to one year in prison after his negligence allowed a horse to escape, causing a fatal car accident. Investigators revealed that he had also starved eight horses to death.

The move was not an isolated incident. City authorities pursued what they called a “sanctification project” at Tapgol Park 25 years ago, during which older people were pushed aside in the name of improving the park’s appearance. Now, critics say little has changed in how the city treats its older residents. While disruptive behavior should be addressed, they argue, enforcement must be more carefully calibrated — one that respects seniors’ autonomy rather than simply displacing them. Lee Kang-won, a professor of Japanese regional culture at Incheon National University who conducted field research in the Tapgol area in the early 2000s, says older people have repeatedly been pushed aside by administrative measures. In 2001, the Seoul Metropolitan Government launched the “sanctification project” at Tapg"

The appellate court partially overturned an earlier ruling ordering the defendant, identified only as A, to pay an additional 5 million won each to V and Jungkook. The court said the revised damages better reflected the harm caused to the artists’ reputations. In the original ruling in February last year, the court ordered A to pay 51 million won to BTS’ agency BigHit Music, 10 million won to V and 15 million won to Jungkook.

In his speech, Al-Issa highlighted a range of initiatives, programs and successful experiences undertaken by the Muslim World League across different regions of the world. He reviewed several prominent models that have produced tangible positive impact, including a League initiative welcomed and supported by the United Nations at its headquarters in New York, titled “Building Bridges of Understanding and Cooperation Between East and West.” The initiative marked the first comprehensive international effort with implementation programs aimed at correcting narratives of inevitable civilizational conflict, which have been among the leading drivers of hate-related practices and their dangerous consequences. Al-Issa stressed that Islam, while fundamentally a monotheistic faith, represents a comprehensive system of values within a moral framework that views human beings as dignified and accountable for their words, actions and choices. He noted that Islamic teachings affirm justice as a core value essential to social stability and the protection of human dignity and rights, without discrimination based on race or religious affiliation. He explained that mercy lies at the heart of the Islamic worldview as a central human value guiding ethical engagement with others and with difference. Citing examples, Al-Issa said Islam calls for peace and tolerance as the foundation of sound human relations, viewing coexistence as the norm rather than the exception. “From this perspective, Islam aligns with the shared humanitarian principles embraced by the contemporary world, as reflected in the United Nations Charter and the international laws, norms and conventions derived from it, which focus on safeguarding human dignity, regulating relations and refining conduct — a principle Islam expressed as the completion of noble moral character,” he said. Al-Issa noted that the Muslim World League has worked to bridge relations among Islamic schools of thought and to clarify the Islamic civilizational approach to engaging with a world marked by religious, ethnic and cultural diversity. He said this effort extends to key issues such as family, education, the environment, citizenship and coexistence through the Makkah Declaration. The declaration was endorsed by more than 1,200 muftis and scholars in Makkah and later adopted by the 57 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. He also referenced the “Building Bridges Between Islamic Schools of Thought” document, noting that large numbers of imams worldwide are being trained on the principles of both documents. Al-Issa said the Makkah Declaration affirms that Muslims are an active part of the global community, engaging constructively with all its components for the benefit of humanity. It recognizes diversity in beliefs, religions and schools of thought as a universal reality and affirms the equality of all people in their shared humanity and common origin. He added that the declaration underscores the importance of civilizational dialogue as the most effective means of understanding in a diverse world, identifying shared values and overcoming barriers to coexistence. It also affirms the innocence of religions and doctrines from the crimes or mistakes committed by their followers or those who falsely claim affiliation, and rejects linking faiths to such acts. Al-Issa concluded by emphasizing the importance of global solidarity among all peace-oriented institutions to strengthen friendship and cooperation among nations and peoples through joint initiatives and programs whose impact can be measured and sustainably developed."

The delivery forms part of a recently announced Saudi developmental and economic support package, which includes 28 development projects and initiatives valued at SR1.9 billion. Under the program, the Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen signed an agreement with Yemen’s Ministry of Energy and Electricity to procure fuel derivatives from the Yemeni oil company PetroMasila. The agreement aims to supply more than 70 electricity generation plants nationwide, reinforcing institutional capacity and supporting the stability and continuity of electricity services. The total volume of fuel derivatives included in the grant amounts to 339 million liters of diesel and mazut, valued at $81.2 million, designated to operate power stations across various governorates. The grant is expected to enhance the efficiency of government institutions, support economic recovery, and improve public services by increasing the reliability of electricity supply to hospitals, medical centers, roads, schools, airports, and ports. It is also anticipated to boost commercial activity and overall economic movement in Yemen. Saudi Arabia has previously provided multiple fuel grants to Yemen, including a $180 million grant in 2018, $422 million in 2021, $200 million in 2022, in addition to the current fuel grant for 2026."

The high-level meeting was confirmed by Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Economy and Planning Faisal F. Alibrahim, following its initial announcement during the 2025 WEF Annual Meeting. The gathering will bring together global leaders to advance dialogue on economic cooperation, stability, and growth amid mounting geopolitical and structural challenges. Speaking in Davos, Alibrahim stressed that stability remains central to reviving global growth, warning against the illusion of quick fixes.“Stability can’t be quickly built, and it can’t be bought,” he said. “Stability needs to be founded, nurtured, protected, reinforced, and guided. Stability is non-negotiable.” He emphasized the importance of sustained engagement and pragmatic collaboration, noting that no single forum can resolve global challenges in isolation. However, he said each convening offers an opportunity to strengthen the culture of cooperation required for progress. “No single convening, no matter how well intentioned, will resolve every global challenge,” Alibrahim said. “But each time, there is an opportunity for us to be resolute, deeply invested, and to build the culture that allows cooperation to function in the first place.” Inviting global leaders to attend the Jeddah meeting, Alibrahim said it would build on the momentum of the WEF Special Meeting held in Riyadh, describing Saudi Arabia as “a global capital of pragmatism and of consequence.” “At a time when the global economy is confronting long-standing structural challenges, this effort helps move cooperation from intent to outcome,” he added, highlighting the focus on accountability and results-driven dialogue. WEF President Børge Brende welcomed the announcement, underscoring the Forum’s expanding engagement with the Kingdom.“We are pleased to return to Saudi Arabia in 2026 to carry forward the conversations started at our Annual Meeting,” Brende said, adding that the forum aims to ensure dialogue translates into meaningful collaboration and action."

      "summary": "RIYADH — Saudi Arabia is preparing to define approximately 170 geographical scopes where non-Saudis may own real estate or acquire real rights across the Kingdom, according to official clarifications published on the newly launched Saudi Properties platform by the Real Estate General Authority.The planned scopes are expected to cover ownership zones in major cities including Riyadh and Jeddah, as well as cities and governorates across the Kingdom, with specific provisions related to Makkah and Madinah. The geographical scopes document is expected to include detailed maps identifying permitted locations, ownership percentages, types of real rights, duration of ownership permissions, and regulatory controls applicable to non-Saudi owners.However, the authority emphasized that the geographical scopes document has not yet been issued, and that detailed information will only be released once all required regulatory approvals are completed.According to the authority, the geographical scope in which non-Saudis may own real estate or acquire real rights will be determined by a decision of the Council of Ministers, based on a proposal from the authority’s board of directors and approval by the Council of Economic and Development Affairs. Economic considerations, security requirements, and population density will be among the key factors taken into account when defining eligible areas.The authority confirmed that ownership in the cities of Makkah and Madinah will be permitted exclusively for Muslim individuals, and only within approved geographical scopes. Such ownership will be subject to special requirements that respect the religious specificity and sovereign status of the two holy cities.Under the updated real estate ownership regulations issued in 1447 AH (2025), eligibility has been expanded to include individuals, Saudi companies with foreign ownership, non-profit entities, and diplomatic missions. Ownership is permitted across approved zones for various property types, while sovereign and security-sensitive locations remain excluded.The updated framework marks a significant shift from the previous regulations issued in 1421 AH (2000), under which ownership by non-Saudis was more limited, restricted to specific property types and locations, and entirely prohibited in Makkah and Madinah, where only usufruct rights were permitted.The authority noted that the system regulating non-Saudi ownership of real estate is designed to organize property ownership by residents and foreign investors in line with national interests and economic priorities, while safeguarding Saudi Arabia’s religious, cultural, and social identity.It added that any geographical scopes document — as well as future amendments — will be subject to strict regulatory procedures, including alignment with the Kingdom’s general ownership policy and formal approval by the Council of Ministers in accordance with the law.The authority stressed that further details on ownership zones, controls, and implementation mechanisms will be announced officially once the geographical scopes document is finalized and approved."

      "summary": "RIYADH — The Saudi Real Estate General Authority announced on Thursday the official entry into force of the Regulation on Real Estate Ownership by Non-Saudis, marking the start of its implementation within the Kingdom’s legislative framework, according to the Saudi Press Agency. The authority said applications for real estate ownership by non-Saudis will be accepted exclusively through the official digital platform, Saudi Properties, which serves as the unified portal for all related procedures. The service covers residents inside the Kingdom, non-residents, as well as non-Saudi companies and entities, in accordance with defined regulatory controls and approval mechanisms. The application process varies depending on the applicant’s category. Residents of Saudi Arabia may submit applications directly through the portal using their residency (iqama) number, with eligibility verified automatically and all procedures completed electronically. For non-residents, applications will begin through Saudi missions and embassies abroad, which issue a digital identity enabling applicants to proceed with the ownership process via the Saudi Properties platform. Non-Saudi companies and entities without a physical presence in the Kingdom are required to first register with the Ministry of Investment through the Invest Saudi platform and obtain a Unified Number (700) before submitting ownership applications electronically. The authority confirmed that the regulation permits ownership across various regions of the Kingdom. Ownership in Riyadh and Jeddah, as well as in the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, will be governed by a specific regulatory framework based on geographic zoning, which is expected to be announced in the first quarter of 2026. According to the authority, ownership in Makkah and Madinah will be restricted to Saudi companies and Muslim individuals, whether residing inside or outside the Kingdom. It added that the Saudi Properties portal acts as the official digital gateway for implementing the regulation, allowing applicants to complete procedures, verify compliance with regulatory requirements, and finalize ownership through a system directly linked to the national real estate title registration platform. This integration aims to enhance transparency and protect ownership rights. The authority said the regulation seeks to improve the quality of real estate development by attracting international developers and high-caliber companies, while supporting growth across residential, commercial, industrial, and tourism sectors. It is also expected to contribute to job creation for Saudi nationals and strengthen the non-oil real estate sector’s contribution to gross domestic product. Commenting on the rollout, the authority’s official spokesperson Taiseer Al Mofarej said that during the first quarter of this year, the specific sites and geographic zones eligible for ownership will be announced as part of the “Geographical Areas for Ownership Document.” He stressed that any information currently circulating about specific residential or commercial projects approved for non-Saudi ownership has not been officially announced, urging investors and the public to rely solely on official sources for accurate and up-to-date information."
