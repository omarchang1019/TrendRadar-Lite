Trains to the airport, which serves more than 70 million passengers a year, are filled with travelers — and with flight attendants commuting to work in full uniform. Even in freezing weather, they can be seen wearing thin jackets and low shoes that leave their ankles exposed. The sight has become a familiar part of the airport’s daily rhythm. Behind the scenes, however, lies a less visible reality. Many of these flight attendants are not choosing to commute in uniform, but are forced to — because their employers do not provide facilities like changing rooms. According to an aviation industry worker, the reason flight attendants report to work in thin uniforms that are not warm enough for the cold weather is simple: Airlines do not provide adequate changing rooms or lockers. The practice is not limited to low-cost carriers. Even Korean Air, a full-service airline that markets itself as a global carrier, requires flight attendants to arrive at work already in uniform or to change c"

The committee called for the swift introduction of the RFID system in handling firearms in the military, saying such accidents can be \"technically managed.\" The RFID system involves wireless technology using radio waves to identify and track tags embedded on guns to gather data on their current location and the person carrying the firearm. The military introduced the RFID system for firearms last year to some units in a pilot project and plans to apply it to five more Army, Navy and Air Force units this year.
