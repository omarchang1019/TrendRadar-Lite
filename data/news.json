I love vintage fashion, so I mostly hunt for obscure knitting patterns from all over (UK, Netherlands, Germany, France and Japan mainly), translate, redraft and rewrite everything and then use a combination of machine and hand knitting and crochet to recreate the pieces.</p> <p>It's a really tough niche to work in as the general public doesn't know much about knitting and the time and skill it takes to make properly fitted clothes. Also many people think domestic knitting machines are printers but for clothing, which couldn't be further from the truth 😅-- it's a ton of manual/physical labour.</p> <p>It has been a rough year with ups and downs and many 12h+ days of working, but it has paid off! I sold some of my work and finished my first gig for an opera last November and I'm hoping I'll get more entertainment gigs in the future :)</p> <p>Here's a selection of things I've knit and crocheted last year :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SejiFields\"> /u/SejiFields </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/\"> r/somethingimade </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qczbjn\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/1qczbjn/my_first_year_as_a_knitwear_maker/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"

The reform does not create a new military branch alongside the Army, Navy and Air Force. Instead, it redefines how the Marines are commanded and what responsibilities they formally carry out, while keeping them institutionally within the Navy. Defense officials say the goal is to correct a long-standing imbalance between authority and responsibility, rather than to expand the force or alter Korea’s joint command system. At the center of the change is operational control — who commands Marine units in peacetime and who is responsible when crises arise. Long-standing command imbalance Although the Marine Corps Headquarters was reestablished in 1987, its main combat units have not been under full Marine control for decades. Since 1973, the Army has had operational control of the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions, leaving the Marine Corps with administrative authority but limited command over its own fro"

It’s said that flanerie is not just walker, but a way of being in the city, closely tied to modern urban life, poetry, philosophy and the art of observation. As he explains, a flaneur is not simply someone who walks a lot, but who walks not to arrive somewhere, but to absorb modern life, faces, gestures, fashion, decay, beauty and boredom.
