Pyongyang reacted angrily by accusing South Korea of infringing on its sovereignty. The Seoul Central District Court will question Oh about the charges before deciding whether to issue a warrant for his arrest. A military-police investigation task force requested the warrant after concluding that the suspect had flown the drones to test their performance for a drone business.

The task force has been investigating seven people in connection with the drone flights, including Oh, those allegedly involved in the aircraft's production, and military and spy agency officials."
