A total of 297 firefighters and 85 vehicles have been dispatched to the area, with authorities also seeking to deploy firefighting helicopters. Poor visibility has prevented helicopters from taking off. Firefighters rushed to the scene after receiving a report of a fire that broke out at an unoccupied house.

The DPK will put the bill to a vote during a plenary session as the opposition's filibuster to block the move ends later in the day after reaching its 24-hour limit. The bill for the second round of the comprehensive special counsel probe would reopen investigations into alleged insurrection charges related to Yoon's failed martial law bid, along with corruption allegations tied to former first lady Kim Keon Hee and the 2023 death of a Marine, covering 17 allegations that were not fully addressed by the three previous counsels. The DPK, which currently holds a parliamentary majority with 163 out of 296 seats, is expected to push the bill through. The move is likely to deepen bipartisan tensions ahead of the local elections in June, with the PPP denouncing the DPK's push as politically motivated and the DPK calling fo"

The five minor parties are the Rebuilding Korea Party, the New Reform Party, the Basic Income Party, the Jinbo Party and the Social Democratic Party. During the meeting, Lee is expected to share the outcomes of his recent visits to China and Japan, exchange views on overall state affairs, and ask for political support for the government's policy efforts."

A verdict is set to be delivered at the Seoul Central District Court at 2 p.m. The session will be televised live after the court accepted broadcasters' request. Yoon is accused of ordering the Presidential Security Service to block investigators' execution of a warrant to detain him in January last year, violating the rights of nine Cabinet members who were not called to a meeting to review his martial law plan, and drafting and later destroying a revised proclamation after the martial law decree was lifted.

Years of incentive payments, pilot projects and increases in medical school quotas have so far failed to ease the shortage of physicians in emergency rooms, maternity wards and key specialties in smaller cities and rural counties. Health authorities say a mandatory system is now needed to maintain — or at least stabilize — medical services outside the capital region. The regional doctor system has become a key part of President Lee Jae Myung’s health care plan. Last month, lawmakers passed a law that makes the system official and gives the government the power to require doctors to work in hospitals and clinics outside the capital. At its core, the scheme reserves a set share of medical school seats for “regional tracks,” in which students receive government financial support for tuition, dormitory fees"
