But the Constitutional Crisis is over. We Lost. </p> <p>Trial Courts have fought valiantly, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly abdicated its Role, and handed over unprecedented power to the President. Not any President — certainly not a Democratic president — but to <em>one</em> President: Donald Trump. </p> <p>The Supreme Court will not save us. And for reasons that I cannot fathom, they seem to welcome the turn towards authoritarianism. </p> <p>Now, I recognize that it hasn't been seamless, there has been plenty of buffoonery. Trump exists in such a dense bubble of misinformation, that I think he truly believes everyone else is as corrupt as he is. </p> <p>And that delusion has led him to empower some of the most incompetent Loyalists alive: Lindsey Halligan, Alina Habba, and Emil Bove, who have bungled his Revenge Fantasies. And some of their ham-fisted schemes have exploded in their faces. </p> <p>And certain Institutions, especially Lower Courts and Juries, have Pushed Back. </p> <p>But the terrifying part is this: </p> <p>Their corrupt plans might have worked if they weren't so dumb. And eventually a more competent Authoritarian will step in and <em>finish</em> what they started. </p> <p>As Professor Nicholas Grossman put it: </p> <p>“<em>In normal democracy terms, we're in bad shape and things are getting worse. In consolidated authoritarianism terms, we're doing pretty well, as the regime is haphazard, meeting resistance, and growing increasingly unpopular</em>.”</p> <p>And I think he's absolutely right. But I'm not confident that that will still be true 3 years from now. </p> <p>And look, I don't think we're beyond salvation...yet. We <em>do</em> still have a choice. </p> <p>But 3 years from now, a whole lot of these Bastards are gonna need to go to Jail. </p> <p>There will be enormous political pressure to just move on, and pretend like this never happened. Arguably, like President Biden did after 2021. </p> <p>But authoritarianism is like cancer. Ignore it, and it spreads. Pretend it's gone, and it comes back worse. </p> </blockquote> <p>- Devin J.

The number of single-person households came to 8.05 million as of end-2024, accounting for 36.1 percent of the total, according to a social security factbook released by the welfare ministry. The figure has been on a steady rise from 5.2 million in 2015 to 6.64 million in 2020, accounting for 31.7 percent of all households and breaching the 30 percent mark for the first time in history. If this upward trend continues, the number of single-person households is expected to reach 8.55 million in 2027, 9.71 million in 2037 and 9.94 million in 2042. Meanwhile, the number of senior citizens aged 65 or older have surpassed the 10 million mark for the first time last year, with Korea entering the \"super-aged\" society, as the share of its elderly population surpassed 20 percent."
