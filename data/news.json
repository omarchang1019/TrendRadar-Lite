      "summary": "President Lee Jae Myung on Tuesday lambasted a far-right civic group for demanding the removal of statues of a girl representing victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, calling it an \"absurd\" case of defamation of the deceased. Lee made the remarks on X, formerly Twitter, as he posted a news article reporting that police have launched an investigation into the head of the group for allegedly insulting such statues nationwide. \"This is an absurd case of defamation of the deceased,\" Lee wrote. According to the news report, the activist group held multiple protest rallies in front of such statues across the nation, calling for their removal and disparaging the victims. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in front-line brothels for Japanese soldiers during the war. Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910-45."

      "summary": "BUSAN — The Busan Museum will host \"Voices of the Masters,\" a live performance event that invites people to experience British literature as spoken word rather than text on a page, this Saturday. The event is organized in connection with the museum's current exhibition, \"Writers Revealed: 500 Years of Literature and Art from Shakespeare,\" and presented in partnership with Liquid Arts Network, which marks its 25th anniversary this year. Twelve performers — writers, musicians, artists and educators based in Busan and elsewhere in Korea — will present excerpts from authors featured in the exhibition. Works by William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Ian Fleming, George Orwell, Sylvia Plath, Zadie Smith, Seamus Heaney, Rudyard Kipling and Elizabeth Barrett Browning are on the program. Performances will include literary readings, spoken word, poetry and limited musical interpretation. Commentary is minimal and used only when helpful for context, ensuring that the text itself remains central. Rather than academic lectures or analysis, the event emph"

      "summary": "It's been over a decade since Paul Brickey — a former army brat, runaway teen, punk, soldier — last set foot on the Korean Peninsula. Now a grizzled mountain man in his early 40s, he's migrated between Korea and the U.S. many times throughout his life. Whether he'll admit it or not, he's one of the most influential voices in Korea's small punk scene, if not the single most important foreign national to have performed in the country's dingiest basement punk venues. Brickey formed his first band while studying at the now-closed Seoul American High School on Yongsan Garrison. At the time, the base had a music room equipped with everything a band needs, and he and his friends played music there as early as 1998. Around 2000, he started his first band ever, named Merge \"after a vulgar T-shirt that was sold in Itaewon back then,\" he told The Korea Times. The very first venue where they performed in front of an audience was Woodstock in Itaewon. Shortly after that, he discovered the Hongdae music scene from the \"cooler, older kids,\" and Merge started playing Tuesday night shows at the venu"
