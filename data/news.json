And up until this point, I never imagined myself to be in a situation where my life expectancy has gone down to possibly weeks. I am currently at one of Canada's best hospitals in Toronto, Ontario; keeping myself afloat through these trying times. Despite it all, I was given the opportunity to make any request for my stay, and this is the one I have chosen. I have been a Doom fan since 2016, and it helped me get through some tough times. I've played through both the Reboot and Eternal (along with its DLCs) and I have nothing but great memories pouring all of my attention into the world of Doom.</p> <p>TDA has been one of the few games I have anticipated and hoped to play since its release. Financial issues got in the way, and I kept clinging on the hope that I'll be able to play the game one day, among others.</p> <p>I am grateful that, despite the grim outlook that I am facing, the hospital was able to secure not only a PS5, but a copy of the game. I am currently blasting my way through hordes of demons in Chapter 4 and I have nothing but childish glee as I return to my roots as a badass Demon Slayer. I may not live to see the upcoming DLC, but I am nonetheless happy to finally play the game in my own hands.</p> <p>To the developers of ID Software, thank you for bringing such a beautiful piece of art that not only brought the FPS genre to its roots, but also revitalize and reinvented the wheel that no other game could. Not only that, but thank you for crafting such an awesome series for a fan like me.</p> <p>Rip &amp; Tear, lads!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wanderingreader123\"> /u/Wanderingreader123 </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/\"> r/Doom </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qsei9w\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/1qsei9w/my_days_are_nearing_and_my_local_hospital_allowed/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"
