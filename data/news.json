Once seen as dangerous and unwanted, nuclear facilities are now viewed as a last-ditch way to stem population decline and revive local economies. On Friday, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP), a subsidiary of the state-run Korea Electric Power Corp., posted a notice inviting applications for new nuclear sites. It is inviting bids to host two large nuclear reactors with a combined capacity of 2.8 gigawatts and a 0.7‑gigawatt small modular reactor (SMR). Municipalities that wish to participate are required to submit an application, including a consent resolution from their local councils, by March 30. The announcement follows the Lee Jae Myung administration’s decision to move ahead with additional nuclear construction to support the age of artificial intelligence (AI), which relies on energy‑hungry data centers and other power‑intensive infrastructure. In Ulsan’s Ulju County, some residents began campaigning even before the KHNP no"

These remarks were made during a workshop held as part of the 68th regular meeting of the E-Commerce Council, attended by representatives of 25 government entities and chaired by Minister of Commerce Majed Al-Qasabi, alongside several council members. UNCTAD experts noted that the organization is working with Saudi Arabia on a comprehensive framework to measure the size and value of e-commerce and digital trade in the Kingdom. The framework aims to assess the level of digital trade adoption, measure transaction values and sector growth, and boost sector competitiveness, while strengthening digital economy policies and improving the efficiency of government services for the business sector. The council has formed a working group, chaired by its secretariat and comprising 11 government entities as members, to oversee the implementation of the project in cooperation with UNCTAD. The initiative is expected to position the Kingdom as a global leader, as the project incorporates mechanisms for measuring e-commerce across all classifications in line with internationally recognized definitions. The regular meeting also discussed the council’s collaborative initiatives with international organizations and relevant government entities to facilitate e-commerce and identify necessary regulatory and procedural reforms.Participants were briefed on the Transport General Authority’s plan to address high seasonal demand, particularly during Ramadan.
