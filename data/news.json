I refused to believe that. </p> <p>In 2022, not only did I lose my job due to blatant discrimination after disclosing the symptoms of my Endometriosis, but the aftermath upended my entire life. Just 5 days later, my then-husband left because the financial strain was more than our marriage could survive. For the next three months, I was homeless. The future I had spent so long building collapsed in just a matter of two weeks. I lost everything. But I turned this loss into fire.</p> <p>I wrote every brief. I deposed every witness. I argued alone in federal court. I learned the law as I lived it and refused to let my harm be treated as ordinary. None of it was easy but all of it was necessary. </p> <p>Some say that this is the first case in all of North Carolina to recognize endometriosis as an ADA disability, and the first case in the nation to allow a plaintiff to proceed on this theory. As of yesterday, it was resolved for a substantial settlement, but more importantly, for institutional reform.</p> <p>This season has taught me so much about the importance of persevering against all odds. It taught me that change only happens when we are bold enough to fight back; even when others try to convince us otherwise. I know now more than ever that I have been called to do this work, and that is a call that I will continue to answer with a resounding “yes.”</p> <p>Yet, the work is not finished. As of this week, I am halfway through law school and will be continuing my fight for civil rights for all people as a civil rights attorney upon graduating.</p> <p>I end by reaffirming that I am committed to fighting just as fervently for the rights of my future clients as I have for myself. This is quite literally just the beginning and I am eager to see what is to come.</p> <p>But as for now…this case is SETTLED👩🏿‍⚖️</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cw9241\"> /u/cw9241 </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/\"> r/MadeMeSmile </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/qet6o427lu8g1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1ptfmg3/i_settled_an_endometriosis_disability/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"

      "summary": "Korea's homegrown KF-21 fighter jets under development will be fitted with air-to-ground capabilities starting in 2027, ahead of schedule, the state arms procurement agency said Tuesday. The plan comes as authorities plan to spend around 700 billion won ($472 million) to conduct a series of tests involving 10 different types of air-to-ground weapons until the end of 2028, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). The plan is expected to secure ground attack capabilities for the homegrown fighter jet around 1 1/2 years earlier than planned, in a move strengthening the Air Force's strength and positively affecting potential exports, DAPA said. Korea launched the KF-21 development program in 2015 to acquire a homegrown supersonic fighter to replace the Air Force's aging fleet of U.S.-made jets, including the F-5. The first production model of the indigenous fighter jet entered final assembly in May."

It marked the first time a main opposition party leader has personally launched a filibuster in South Korea. The previous record was held by PPP lawmaker Park Soo-min, who spoke for 17 hours and 12 minutes on Sept. 26. During the address, Jang accused the ruling party of seeking to create court benches made up of judges it favors and attempting to take control over the judiciary, calling the bill unconstitutional. He also urged President Lee Jae Myung to veto the bill if it passes the Assembly. The DPK has pushed for the tribunal"

Amid concerns over the collection of biometric information, the government said the process only verifies whether applicants' actual faces match the photos on their identification cards and that the data will not be stored.
