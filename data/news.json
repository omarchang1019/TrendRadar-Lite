The Supreme Court’s Second Division sent the case back to the Patent Court, finding that modifying a branded product for personal use does not amount to “use of a trademark” under Korean law if the refashioned item is not distributed commercially. The case involved a repair shop operator in Seoul’s upscale Gangnam district who altered customers’ worn Louis Vuitton bags into smaller bags and wallets between 2017 and 2021. The operator charged between 100,000 won ($70) and 700,000 won per item, earning a total of 23.8 million won. Louis Vuitton filed a lawsuit in February 2022, arguing that in the course of producing items bearing the Louis Vuitton mark, the operator had undermined the trademark’s functions, including its role in indicating the source of the goods and guaranteeing quality.

      "summary": "JEDDAH — A Saudi official said that the policies and practices of the Israeli occupation authorities constitute the greatest threat to security and peace, reiterating that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory.On behalf of Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, Deputy Foreign Minister Eng. Waleed El-Khereiji participated on Thursday in the emergency open-ended meeting of the Executive Committee at the level of foreign ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), held in Jeddah to discuss Israeli decisions concerning the occupied Palestinian territory.At the outset of his remarks, El-Khereiji thanked the State of Palestine for calling for the extraordinary meeting.“We meet today with a shared conviction that the policies and practices of the Israeli occupation authorities constitute the greatest threat to security and peace, and with determination to confront this threat by coordinating our positions, developing mechanisms of cooperation among us, and strengthening our joint Islamic action,” he said.He added that the unprecedented Israeli aggression against the occupied Palestinian territories continues in flagrant violation of international laws and humanitarian norms through measures aimed at expanding settlement activity, deepening annexation and attempting to impose alleged Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, undermining prospects for peace and contravening international legitimacy resolutions.El-Khereiji reaffirmed the Kingdom’s condemnation of the decision by the occupation authorities to classify West Bank lands as so-called “state property,” as well as Israeli Knesset decisions calling for accelerating settlement expansion and permitting land purchases in the West Bank. He said such plans seek to impose a new legal and administrative reality and undermine efforts to achieve peace and stability.“The Kingdom reiterates that there is no sovereignty for Israel over the occupied Palestinian land,” he said, expressing absolute rejection of these plans and all illegal measures that violate international law and UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 2334. He also condemned settlement activities aimed at altering the demographic composition and legal status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem.El-Khereiji stressed the importance of the Global Alliance for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution in unifying international efforts, mobilizing political and economic support, and advancing relevant implementation tracks to translate commitments into practical steps and accelerate the realization of the two-state solution. He affirmed the Kingdom’s commitment to continuing this path with brotherly and friendly countries to achieve a just and comprehensive peace that fulfills the Palestinian people’s aspirations for self-determination and an independent state in line with the Arab Peace Initiative.He said that the New York Declaration, the comprehensive peace plan and UN Security Council Resolution 2803 constitute an integrated framework aligned in their objectives. He emphasized the need to support the Palestinian National Authority, build its institutional capacities, and ensure institutional and geographic linkage between Gaza and the West Bank to preserve the unity of the Palestinian territory, while safeguarding the Palestinian people’s inalienable rights, foremost among them the right to self-determination and the right of return. He also renewed the call for the urgent entry of humanitarian and relief aid in full coordination with international mechanisms.El-Khereiji commended the efforts led by US President Donald Trump in this regard, noting that coordination with the United States to implement the comprehensive peace plan represents a genuine opportunity to end the conflict and move toward regional integration and sustainable stability.In closing, he reaffirmed that, out of the Kingdom’s commitment to stability and peace, Saudi Arabia condemns and denounces any violation of the sovereignty of any OIC member state.He expressed concern over rising military tensions and increasingly hostile rhetoric, calling for restraint, de-escalation and resolving disputes through diplomatic means.He stressed that sustainable peace and security can only be achieved through dialogue, diplomacy, mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of states, and the peaceful settlement of disputes."

      "summary": "JEDDAH — The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Thursday adopted a communique at an emergency open-ended meeting of its Executive Committee at the level of foreign ministers, condemning Israel’s efforts to impose an “illegal occupation reality” and expand settlement and annexation policies in the occupied Palestinian territory.The meeting, held at the OIC General Secretariat headquarters in Jeddah on Feb. 26, 2026, was convened at the request of the State of Palestine to address Israel’s recent announcements concerning the West Bank, including Al-Quds Al-Shareef.In the communique, the ministers reaffirmed the centrality of the Palestinian cause and Al-Quds Al-Shareef to the Islamic Ummah and reiterated support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine within the June 4, 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, as well as the right of return in accordance with UN Resolution 194.The meeting strongly condemned the hostile decisions and measures by Israel aimed at expanding control and deepening annexation policies in the West Bank, including Al-Quds Al-Shareef, declaring such decisions “null and void” and calling for their immediate rescission.It rejected any form of annexation and denounced settlement expansion, land confiscation, forced displacement and demographic changes in the territory occupied since 1967.The ministers also condemned ongoing Israeli actions at the Ibrahimi Mosque and rejected any attempts to alter the legal and historical status of Al-Aqsa Mosque.The communique affirmed that the entire 144,000-square-meter compound is a place of worship exclusively for Muslims and is under the custodianship of King Abdullah II of Jordan, with the Al-Quds Waqf Department as the sole authority responsible for its administration.The meeting further criticized recent statements attributed to the US ambassador to Israel and the decision by the US Embassy in Jerusalem to provide consular services to settlers in illegal settlements, calling such measures a violation of international law, including the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.The OIC ministers called for a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, full withdrawal of Israeli forces, facilitation of humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, and support for the State of Palestine in assuming its responsibilities across all Palestinian territories.They stressed the unity and integrity of the West Bank, including East Al-Quds, and the Gaza Strip as one indivisible geographical and political unit.The communique urged the international community, particularly the UN General Assembly and the Security Council, to assume their responsibilities by rejecting and condemning Israeli measures and compelling Israel to cease actions deemed illegal under international law.It also called on member states to consider political and legal measures, including recourse to international courts, and to exert pressure through diplomatic and economic means.The meeting condemned what it described as attacks against UN agencies operating in the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly UNRWA, and called for sustained political, legal and financial support for the agency.In a broader regional context, the ministers expressed concern over escalating tensions in the Middle East, including threats of the use of force against Iran and the buildup of military forces. They reaffirmed that threats or use of force against a sovereign state violate international law and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and emphasized dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful settlement of disputes as the only path to sustainable peace and security.The meeting welcomed recent diplomatic engagement between Iran and the United States and expressed support for efforts aimed at reducing tensions, while appreciating the role of countries including Oman, Türkiye, Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in facilitating dialogue.The Secretary-General of the OIC was tasked with following up on the implementation of the communique and reporting to the next meeting of foreign ministers."

He made the remarks while attending an interactive dialogue on the High Commissioner's report on the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories during the 61st session of the UN Human Rights Council. Bin Khothaila strongly denounced the Israeli occupation forces' demolition of buildings belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), holding the international community accountable for confronting these practices and the Israeli approach of continuing its violations and crimes against international relief organizations. He reiterated Saudi Arabia’s absolute rejection of these illegal measures, saying that “this constitute a grave violation of international law, undermine the two-state solution, and represent an attack on the inherent right of the Palestinian people to establish their independent and sovereign state on the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”"

Attending the enhanced interactive dialogue on Sudan at the 61st session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Thursday, Bin Khothaila affirmed Saudi Arabia’s commitment to continuing all efforts to end the humanitarian crisis and alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people. “Since the outbreak of the conflict in Sudan, Saudi Arabia shouldered its responsibility towards its Sudanese brothers and sisters, leading diplomatic efforts to resolve the Sudanese crisis. “These efforts resulted in the signing of the Jeddah Declaration by the conflicting parties on May 11, 2023. The declaration commits to protecting civilians in Sudan, ensuring the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid, respecting international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and agreeing to confidence-building measures,” he said. Bin Khothaila noted that despite the Kingdom’s ongoing efforts and its concern for Sudan and its people, the recent attacks launched by the Rapid Support Forces on El Fasher constitute grave violations of international humanitarian law. “These attacks have resulted in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure and humanitarian convoys,” he said."
